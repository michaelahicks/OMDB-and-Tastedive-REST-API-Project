# OMDB-and-Tastedive-REST-API-Project

This is a REST API Python program that requests data from OMDB and Tastedive, 
cross-references the ratings and returns a list of related movies ranked by their Rotten Tomatoes score.

This project used a module specific to the learning platform on Coursera and will be re-written to use the requests module.
